## üöÄ Project Overview

A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that can synthesize new data samples based on learned representations. This project focuses on encoding Fashion MNIST images into a compressed latent space and generating realistic images from these representations.

## üìã Tasks and Objectives

### **TASK 1: Implement the VAE Model**
- Build an encoder and decoder using convolutional layers.
- Implement latent space sampling using the reparameterization trick.

### **TASK 2: Train the Model**
- Train the VAE using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Monitor and visualize training and test set losses.

### **TASK 3: Optimize Latent Space Dimensionality**
- Experiment with various latent space dimensions (2, 4, 8, 16, 32).
- Evaluate reconstruction quality and test set loss.

### **TASK 4: Visualize Latent Traversals**
- Generate images by varying single and multiple latent dimensions.
- Explore effects of specific latent variables on output.

### **TASK 5: Visualize Class Labels in Latent Space**
- Train a VAE with a 2D latent space.
- Plot latent space representations of different Fashion MNIST classes.

### **TASK 6: Generate and Reconstruct Images**
- Decode random samples from the latent space.
- Compare original images with reconstructed outputs.

## üìä Example Results
- **Image Reconstruction:** Comparing original vs. reconstructed images.
- **Latent Traversals:** Visualizing changes when traversing the latent space.
- **Class Separation:** Latent space visualizations of Fashion MNIST classes.
